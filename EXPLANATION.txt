This JavaScript code is responsible for fetching news articles from various categories using the News API and displaying them on a webpage. Here are some important points to understand:

The code defines variables to store references to HTML elements, such as buttons and the news container.

It declares an array, newsDataArr, to hold the fetched news articles.

The code sets up event listeners for the buttons, which are triggered when a user clicks on a specific category or performs a search.

There are separate functions for fetching news from different categories: fetchHeadlines, fetchGeneralNews, fetchBusinessNews, fetchEntertainmentNews, fetchSportsNews, fetchTechnologyNews, and fetchQueryNews. Each function uses the Fetch API to make an HTTP request to the News API endpoint with the appropriate URL.

The fetched data is stored in the newsDataArr array if the response is successful. If an error occurs, it logs the status and status text and displays a message indicating no data is found.

The displayNews function is responsible for rendering the news articles on the webpage. It iterates over the newsDataArr array and dynamically creates HTML elements to display the news card for each article. The card includes the article's image, title, publication date, description, and a "Read more" link.
